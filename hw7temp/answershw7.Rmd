## Question 1

Use squared error loss (a linear model) and the variables waist, age, sex and bmi to predict log(rdi4p + 1). Interpet the coefficients.
```{r cars}
dat = read.csv("shhs1.txt", header=T, sep="\t")

# using waist, age, sex, bmi to predict log(rdi4p + 1)
x = dat$bmi_s1
y = log(dat$rdi4p + 1)
```

## Question 2

Define sleep disordered breathing as having an rdi4p greater than 15. Use logistic regression to fit a model on having sleep disordered breathing using waist, age, sex and bmi as predictors. Interpret your coefficients.
```{r}

```

## Question 3
Use a logistic regresion model to predict HTNDerv_S1 using age, sex, bmi and rdi4p. Interpret the rdi4p coefficient.
```{r}

```
